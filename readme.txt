2. Python in an iPython Notebook
3. The code is structed in an iPython Notebook where each step is outlined and described
4. a. Ensure that sklearn is downloaded. If not, instructions can be found here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
   b. Open this ipynb in Jupyter, Colab, or any other python notebook interpreter
   c. Hit run at the top, then enjoy! The trinary classifier takes quite some time to complete because it exhaustively searches through all combinations of 3 groups. But the saved output that the notebook initially has is the output of the code blocks.
